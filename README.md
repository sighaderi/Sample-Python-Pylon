In this Python version of the code, we use the pylon module from Pylon to initialize the Pylon runtime system, create a camera object, and start grabbing images. We then enter a loop where we grab images from the camera using camera.RetrieveResult(), which blocks until a new image is available. We access the image data using grab_result.Array, grab_result.Width, grab_result.Height, and grab_result.PixelType. Finally, we process the image data as necessary and display the image size and pixel format using print().
After grabbing all the images we need, we stop the camera using camera.StopGrabbing() and camera.Close(), and then terminate the Pylon runtime system using pylon.pylon_terminate().
